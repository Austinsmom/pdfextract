# TODO

## Tasks with unclassified time period

* DONE Pass receiver through to spatials calls, or construct receiver
  from method calls in spatials calls.
* Write methods to create spatial objects.
* DONE Use show_text_with_positioning to construct text runs.
* DONE Record spatial objects that result from spatials method calls.
* DONE Complete the covert method - write spatial hashs out to xml.
* DONE Write Spatial class with alter method.

## Small tasks, 10 minutes or so

* Improve inclusion of spatial object modules. Shouldn't need to call,
  for example, include_text_runs.
* Pass set of previously constructed spatial objects to sptials calls,
  via a new method in parser - parser.previous :text_runs { ... }.
  Spatial objects such as margins depend on the positions of text
  runs.
