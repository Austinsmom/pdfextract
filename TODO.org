* TODO
** Tasks with unclassified time period
*** DONE Pass receiver through to spatials calls, or construct receiver
    from method calls in spatials calls.
*** DONE Write methods to create spatial objects.
*** DONE Use show_text_with_positioning to construct text runs.
*** DONE Record spatial objects that result from spatials method calls.
*** DONE Complete the covert method - write spatial hashs out to xml.
*** DONE Write Spatial class with alter method.
** Small tasks, 10 minutes or so
*** DONE Improve inclusion of spatial object modules. Shouldn't need to 
    call, for example, include_text_runs.
*** DONE Pass set of previously constructed spatial objects to sptials calls,
    via a new method in parser - parser.previous :text_runs { ... }.
    Spatial objects such as margins depend on the positions of text
    runs.
*** DONE Determine units of and apply correctly :rise and :leading.
*** TODO Handle UserUnit transformations.
*** DONE Reset global text state at the end of each page.
*** DONE Position coords appear a bit above and to the right of where they
    should. Graphics state or page translation?
*** DONE Spaces appear one character before where they should in
    text_chunks.
*** DONE Apostrophes cause a chunk break.
*** DONE Split views into View, PdfView, PngView. Pass only explicit
    spatials in an easier form for Views. Move into lib/view.
*** DONE Move analysis modules into lib/analysis.
*** DONE Non-ascii chars that are transliterated are appearing in output one
    place before they should. Transliterated chars also cause a word
    break. Not getting their width correct in glyph width dict?
    ! Looks like this occurs for chars whose codes are in the font's
    @differences map.
*** DONE pdf_view.rb shouldn't call doc.go_to_page more than once per page.
    Causes objects to be rendered on the wrong page.
*** DONE pdf_view.rb should keep the same auto colour for object types on
    different pages.
*** DONE Some margins calculated with negative x or y. Because of characters
    incorrectly calculated to be out of the mediabox?
*** TODO Some characters don't get a correct width.
*** TODO Should merge with region above from right to left (or, in the
    opposite direction to writing direction). Causes last two lines of
    paragraphs to merge incorrectly.
*** DONE Figure out which state, and when (text object start/end, page
    start/end, text show ops) should be pushed/popped.
*** TODO Move parsing parameters to the Pdf class. Settable via pdf-extract.

** Tasks, up to 3 hours
*** DONE Handle new line operators, and all show text operators.
*** DONE Handle font metrics correctly, including glyph widths, displacement
    vectors and bounding boxes.
*** TODO Handle text matrix when it is applying a rotation.
*** TODO Handle type 3 font font matrices.
*** TODO Handle writing mode selection for composite fonts (type 0)
    (different font metrics). 
*** DONE Some way of splitting SpatialObjects by page.
*** TODO !! Handle type 3 font operators. These may not be supported by 
    pdf-reader!
*** DONE Add spatials parser.post { }, use in text_runs to sort and merge
    adjacent runs. Or split text_runs into characters and text_runs.
*** TODO Implement PNG output. Should be able to specify opacity of each
    spatial object type, so that text runs can be seen even though
    groups and section are overlayed. Or, low opacity for all, auto
    select a different colour for each type.
*** DONE For some PDFs, character width and height not detected correctly.
*** DONE In some PDFs, ascent, descent and bbox info for fonts is not
    available. Seems to be those fonts whose base font is one of the
    base 14.
*** DONE Prawn doesn't render over some PDFs.
*** DONE Assign colour, font, font size to character objects. Pass on to
    text chunks and regions.
*** DONE Characters appear too wide in some3.pdf test PDF.
*** DONE Characters on pages with images are sometimes not detected. Graphics
    state issue?
*** TODO When --margins and --zones specified duplicate margins appear
    in output.
*** TODO Header, footer, body detection should use most frequent page layout
    as layout for all pages.
*** TODO Pass chunk locations through to resolved references.

** Long tasks, greater than 3 hours
*** DONE Examine text_runs spatial definition and determine processing that
    is generic. Move into Parser methods. E.g. Handling global /
    object-specific state.
*** TODO Rewrite pdf.rb.
*** DONE Better organise pre/object/post call storage in pdf.rb . Perhaps
    a pre and post per object type.

** To version 0.1
*** DONE Join regions into sections only when their textual attributes match,
    such as letter ratio.
*** TODO Allow skipping when joining regions, or try to join vertically, then
    horizontally. Should allow for merging of disparate regions such
    as at the end of an article and beginning of another.
*** TODO Either move pdf-reader changes into pdf-extract or get patches committed.
*** TODO Split by line spacing and split by margin
